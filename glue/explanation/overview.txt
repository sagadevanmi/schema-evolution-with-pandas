The code is a class called `SchemaEvolution` that provides methods to perform schema evolution on a dataframe before loading it into a Postgres table.
The class has a constructor that initializes the connection to the Postgres database and a number of methods that perform various tasks related to schema evolution.
The `get_table_schema` method retrieves the schema of a table in Postgres, the `abbreviate_column_name` method abbreviates column names to 62 characters, the `rename_new_columns` method renames new columns to 62 characters, the `update_table_schema` method updates the schema of a table in Postgres, the `create_sqlalchemy_engine` method creates a SQLAlchemy Engine, the `load_to_postgres` method loads a dataframe to a Postgres table, the `check_float_columns` method checks if float columns are actually integers, the `check_schema_compatability` method checks if the schema of a dataframe is compatible with a Postgres table, and the `perform_schema_evolution` method performs schema evolution on a dataframe.
The `process` method is the entry point of the script and it reads a CSV file from S3, performs schema evolution on the dataframe, and loads the evolved dataframe into a Postgres table.
